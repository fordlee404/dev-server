# webpack-dev-server

**THIS SERVER SHOULD BE USED FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY!**

**DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!**

It's forked from [webpack/webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server), add the [grunt-include-replace](https://github.com/alanshaw/grunt-include-replace) into it. So that I can include other files in the html file, it's usefull when I write the html pages which has the common header and footer.

It's a live reloading server for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io).
